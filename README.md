# topic-MLLM-project

**This is the public release of a previously private research project, with certain code components intentionally modified for publication.** 

## Introduction

With the advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), topic modeling has emerged as a prominent area of interest. This project integrates these developments by examining the application of topic modeling to artworks. The methodology includes clustering images, sampling artworks from each cluster, generating descriptions, and identifying commonalities. The results demonstrate the potential of this approach for future applications. 

## Data Collection

We collected over 250 images from various genres, ensuring a diverse and representative dataset.

## Clustering Artworks

The image clustering process involves generating embeddings and applying clustering techniques. Dimensionality reduction techniques were employed to enhance clustering accuracy, resulting in distinct groupings of similar artworks.

## Generating Descriptions

To generate descriptions, we used two multi-modal language models, which provided flexible and detailed outputs. We sampled a subset of images from each cluster for efficiency and fairness. Descriptions were generated for both genre predictions and topic modeling tasks.

## Predicting Genres

Using one-sentence captions, we achieved highly accurate genre predictions. This validated the effectiveness of the clustering and the descriptive capabilities of the multi-modal models.

## Observing Commonalities

We analyzed the generated descriptions to identify visual and content-wise commonalities. The results showcased the ability to capture distinct trends and features within clusters.

## Conclusion

This project combines topic modeling with multi-modal LLMs to analyze artworks efficiently. The approach highlights the potential for future applications in understanding and modeling trends in visual datasets.
